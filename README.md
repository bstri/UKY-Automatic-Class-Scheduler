# UKY Automatic Scheduler

The Automatic Scheduler is a program that turns a list of up to 15 classes into a list of all possible schedules that can be formed with some or all of those classes. It does this by browsing the course catalog and looking at the days and times for each section of each class. A list of specific features follows:

* **Mandatory Courses:** Mark classes as mandatory that must appear in all schedules
* **Credit Hour Range:** Specify a minimum and maximum number of credits that each schedule must satisfy
* **Schedule Sorting:** Sort the schedule list by number of credits, daily start time, daily end time

## Getting Started

## How to Use

### What it can't do

The Automatic Scheduler can't handle a few noteable cases:
* Variable credit classes (unless a section has a set credit number)
* Classes that allow you to register for multiple sections during the same semester
If you find another case you think it doesn't handle correctly, please let me know.
