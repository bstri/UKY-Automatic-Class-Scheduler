# UKY Automatic Scheduler

The Automatic Scheduler is a program that turns a list of up to 15 classes into a list of all possible schedules that can be formed with some or all of those classes. It does this by browsing the course catalog and looking at the days and times for each section of each class. A list of specific features follows:

* **Mandatory Courses:** Mark classes as mandatory that must appear in all schedules
* **Credit Hour Range:** Specify a minimum and maximum number of credits that each schedule must satisfy
* **Schedule Sorting:** Sort the schedule list by number of credits, daily start time, daily end time

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## How to Use

### What it can't do

The Automatic Scheduler can't handle a few noteable cases:
* Variable credit classes (unless a section has a set credit number)
* Classes that allow you to register for multiple sections during the same semester
If you find another case you think it doesn't handle correctly, please let me know.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
